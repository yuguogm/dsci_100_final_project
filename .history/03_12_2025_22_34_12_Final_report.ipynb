    "Minecraft is a video game played by a wide range of people. PLAI, a computer science research group at UBC, aims to collect data about the ways in which individuals play Minecraft by recording their in-game actions. This report seeks to assist PLAI with their recruitment efforts in order to ensure it is optimally targeted. Thus, PLAI has provided us with a dataset collected through an online survey, which contains the name, experience, email, playtime, gender, and age of players. Starting from a broad initial question, we conducted exploratory analysis to narrow it to a specific research question that we hope will yield insightful results that can help PLAI optimally recruit players for their research.\n",

    "- The visualization supports our previous discussion that playing hours are highly skewed, with many low-playtime users and a few players with very large playtimes. Although an interesting trend, we can see with the distribution of played hours by subscription status is that nearly all of the non-subscribed players have playtime around 0, while players with more playtime are almost always subscribed. This trend could be beneficial to our prediction question.\n",
    "- The age visualization shows that our dataset is dominated by young adults. Looking at the distribution of age by subscription status, we see heavy overlap between the ages of players who are subscribed and non-subscribers. But all young players (age < 16) are subscribers, which could make age a beneficial variable in our prediction question.\n",
    "- We can see that subscription rates are relatively similar across experience levels (around 0.7). However, this does not mean that the experience level variable is useless in our prediction question, as it could be helpful in conjunction with another variable to a predictive model trying to answer our question."

    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Why This Method is Appropriate\n",
    "- The problem is a classification problem (cannot use linear regression)\n",
    "- KNN is a good option because it predicts based on similar data points. From our EDA, we have seen some similarity in the subscription status as some of the variables change. For example, all players with high playtime are subscribers. Another example is that almost all young players are subscribers.\n",
    "- KNN can handle some of the skewed variables like played_hours, as most players would be far away from the players with outlier playtime. Thus, the outliers would not be able to heavily influence predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Required Assumptions\n",
    "- Similar points should have similar outcomes.\n",
    "- Numeric representation of all variables. This is pretty achievable with encoding categorical columns.\n",
    "- Scaling will be needed for the KNN model to be effective.\n",
    "- No irrelevant or noisy features.\n",
    "- The dataset should be reasonably balanced. If one class is far more frequent in the dataset, then it will obviously comprise more neighbors and be predicted more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Potential Limitations/Weaknesses\n",
    "- Class imbalance in subscription status may heavily affect predictive performance.\n",
    "- Might not be able to capture linear relationships between variables and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.5 Model Evaluation Plan\n",
    "- Split data into training (70%) and test (30%) sets before any preprocessing or training.\n",
    "- Create a majority classifier model to get baseline statistics.\n",
    "- Perform n-fold cross-validation (n=5 or 10) on the training set, while hyperparameter optimizing k for the KNN model.\n",
